Use this script to install for only apt-based Linux:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revx0012/vscode-linux/main/distros/apt/vscode-apt && bash vscode-apt
```

You need wget, to do so you can try `sudo apt install wget -y` And you also need sudo

It's the same command, just replace wget with sudo (Sudo is commonly in most Linux, so no need to install unless if necessary.)
